# smart-home-automation
This project focuses on building a Smart Home Automation System using Arduino UNO. The  system automates the operation of a light (bulb) and a fan using sensors. The light turns ON  automatically when a person is detected and the surroundings are dark. The fan operates when  a person is detected and temperature exceeds a certain threshold.
